Just some lazy sh script I wrote so I could update my Nobara system easier. Maybe it exists already, idk, but this is just for fun basically. I figured maybe some stranger over the internet would happen to want the same, so eh, here's a way to do it. Also protection from filling your bashrc with the same stuff, so that's cool I'd say.
I don't know if it runs on any other shell, I just use Bash. And don't run it as sudo, the nobara-update has it in there already. I couldn't get it to work using sudo, in fact.
